== Instruction description

AI extension instructions are divided into two categories based on their functionality: dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions and sliding-window dot-product instructions. Different values of VLEN and SEW correspond to different MAC uints.

=== Dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions

Dot-product multiply-accumulate instructions can be categorized into two types: integer dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions and floating-point dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions. During matirx multiplication and accumulating computation, the layout of input and output data in registers is considered as two-dimensional data. The layout of input of integer instructions and floating-point instructions is identical, but layout of output is different. The integer instructions require two registers to store thire output, but the floating-point instructions only require one.

==== Integer dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions

Let's take a closer look at the layout of dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions. The input A in VS1 is treated as _copies_*(M, K) matrices, while the input B in VS2 is treated as _copies_*(K, N). The result C will be stored in two sequential registers (the index of VD(L) must be even), and its elements will be treated as _copies_*(M, N) matrices. For example, when the VLEN=256 and SEW=8, the layout is as described below:

image:int-matrix-multiply-0.png[int-matrix-multiply-0.png]

At this time, assume the max MAC unit (4x4x8) has been implemented. Then the input matrix A is treated as a (4, 8) matrix and B is treated as a (8, 4) matrix. After matrix multiplication, the resulting matrix C is of size (4, 4), whose data type is int32. When VLEN=512 and SEW=8, the _copy_ is 2, the layout can be as stated as follows.

image:int-matrix-multiply-1.png[int-matrix-multiply-1.png]

Input data is stored in VS1 and VS1+1 (the index of VS1 must be even), and the elements of matrix A are sliding-packing from the two (2*4,8) matrices in VS1 and VS1+1. Input B is placed in VS2, with its elements viewed as two (8,4) matrices. The result C consists of two (M,N) matrices, they are stored in two sequential registers (the index of VD(L) must be even).

The integer dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions take matrix A and matrix B as input, and accumulate the multiplication result of A and B into C.

* shape of A: M rows, K columns [x Copies]
* shape of B: K rows, N columns [x Copies]
* shape of C: M rows, N columns [x Copies]

TIP: The value of Copies can be either 1 or 2, Copies=(sqrt(VLEN/64) == floor(sqrt(VLEN/64)) ? 1 : 2)

As mentioned before, this instructions function can be descripted as follows:
....
Copies=(sqrt(VLEN/64) == floor(sqrt(VLEN/64)) ? 1 : 2)
for (cp = 0; cp < Copies; cp++) {
    for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j ++) {
            for (k = 0; k < K; k++) {
                C[cp * M * N + i * N + j] +=
                    int32(A[cp * M * K + i * N + k] * B[cp * K *N + k * N + j]);
                }
             }
         }
     }
 }
....

The data type of supported by the the integer dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions is in the following table.

| instructions | Operand Type A | Operand Type B | Accumulator Type C |

vmadotus | uint4/uint8/uint16 | int4/int8/int16 | int32/int32/fp32 
|===

And the usage of the instructions:

....
# vs1 refers to input A, vs2 refers to input B, and vd refers to output C.

vmadot      vd,     vs1,    vs2
vmadotu     vd,     vs1,    vs2
vmadotsu    vd,     vs1,    vs2
vmadotus    vd,     vs1,    vs2
....

NOTE: the index of vd must be even.


==== Floating point dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions

Same as the integer dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions, the floating point dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate also support _copy_=1 and _copy_=2. The input A in VS1 is considered as _copies_*(M, K) matrices, while the input B in VS2 is considered as _copies_*(K, N). The result C will be stored in two sequential registers (the index of VD(L) must be even), and its elements will be considered as _copies_*(M, N) matrices,. For example, when the VLEN=256 and SEW=8, the layout is as follows:

image:float-matrix-multiply-0.png[float-matrix-multiply-0.png]

At this time, assume the max MAC unit (4x4x8) has been implemented. Then the input matrix A is considered as a (4, 8) matrix and B is considered as a (8, 4) matrix. After matrix multiplication, the resulting matrix C is of size (4, 4), whose data type is fp16 or bfp16. When the VLEN=512 and SEW=8, _copy_ is 2, the layout is shown as follows.

image:float-matrix-multiply-1.png[float-matrix-multiply-1.png]

Input data is stored in VS1 and VS1+1 (the index of VS1 must be even), and the elements of matrix A are sliding-packing from the two (2*4,8) matrices in VS1 and VS1+1. Input B is stored in VS2, with its elements considered as two (8,4) matrices. The result C consists of two (M,N) matrices, they are stored in one registers.

The floating point dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions take matrix A and matrix B as input, and accumulate the multiplication result of A and B into C.

* shape of A: M rows, K columns [x Copies]
* shape of B: K rows, N columns [x Copies]
* shape of C: M rows, N columns [x Copies]

TIP: The value of Copies can be either 1 or 2, Copies=(sqrt(VLEN/64) == floor(sqrt(VLEN/64)) ? 1 : 2)

The function is the same as the integer one.
....
assume FP = fp16 or bfp16
Copies=(sqrt(VLEN/64) == floor(sqrt(VLEN/64)) ? 1 : 2)
for (cp = 0; cp < Copies; cp++) {
    for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j ++) {
            for (k = 0; k < K; k++) {
                C[cp * M * N + i * N + j] +=
                    FP(A[cp * M * K + i * N + k] * B[cp * K *N + k * N + j]);
                }
             }
         }
     }
 }
....

The data type of supported by the the floating-point dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions is in the following table.

.Data type of vfmadot

vfmadot  | fp4/fp8/fp16/bfp16 | fp4/fp8/fp16/bfp16 | fp16/fp16/fp16/bfp16

And the usage of the instructions:

....
# vs1 refers to input A, vs2 refers to input B, and vd refers to output C.

=== Sliding-window dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instruction

The sliding-window dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions can select specified values from two sequential registers, VS1 and VS1+1 to be used as matrix A. The data mode of data of matrix B and Matrix C are the same as the instructions without slide. Depending on the data type, it is further categorised into integer and floating-point types.


==== Integer sliding-window dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instruction

During matrix multiply computation, the layout of input and output data in the registers also can be divided into two situations. The input A will be selected from VS1 and VS1+1 (the index of VS1 must be even), and the selected elements will be considered as _copies_ * (M,K) matrices. Input B is stored in VS2, with elements considered as _copies_ * (K,N) matrices. The result C will be stored in two sequential registers (the index of VD(L) must be even), with elements considered as _copies_ * (M,N) matrices. For example, when the VLEN=256 and SEW=8, the configuration would be as illustrated in the following diagram:

image:int-slide-window-0.png[int-slide-window-0.png]

Elements of A are selected from a (2*4,8) matrix formed by combining VS1 and VS1+1, and matching elements are selected through a specified sliding value. As demonstrated previously, with a slide value of 1, the blue frame slides down 8(1*K) elements. The resulting values form an (4,8) matrix, which serves as input matrix A for the matrix multiply-accumulate calculation. For matrix B and C, are the same as the instructions without slideing.

In the case of VLEN=512, SEW=8, where _copy_ is set to 2, the layout would be as shown in the following diagram:

image:int-slide-window-1.png[int-slide-window-1.png]

The elements in VS1 and VS1+1 can be considered as two (2*4, 8) matrices. Then, in the same manner as with _copy_=1, the matching elements are selected using a specified slide value. The data obtained from the slide are two (M,K) matrices, which serve as input matrices A for the matrix multiply-accumulate computation.

Sliding-window dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions also take matrix A and matrix B as input, and accumulate the multiplication result of A and B into C.

* shape of A: M rows, K columns [x Copies]
* shape of B: K rows, N columns [x Copies]
* shape of C: M rows, N columns [x Copies]

The function description:
....
Copies=(sqrt(VLEN/64) == floor(sqrt(VLEN/64)) ? 1 : 2)
for (cp = 0; cp < Copies; cp++) {
    for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j ++) {
            for (k = 0; k < K; k++) {
                C[cp * M * N + i * N + j] +=
                    int32(A[cp * M * K + slide * K + i * N + k] * B[cp * K *N + k * N + j]);
                }
             }
         }
     }
 }
....

==== Floating point sliding-window dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instruction

Same as the integer one, the layout of input and output data in the registers also can be divided into two situations. The input A will be selected from VS1 and VS1+1 (the index of VS1 must be even), and the selected elements will be considered as _copies_ * (M,K) matrices. Input B is stored in VS2, with elements considered as _copies_ * (K,N) matrices. The result C will be stored in one register, with elements considered as _copies_ * (M,N) matrices. For example, when the VLEN=256 and SEW=8, the layout would be as illustrated in the following diagram:

Sliding-window dot-product matrix multiply-accumulate instructions also take matrix A and matrix B as input, and accumulate the multiplication result of A and B into C.

* shape of A: M rows, K columns [x Copies]
* shape of B: K rows, N columns [x Copies]
